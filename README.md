LPC - 
This folder contains 4 resynthesised versions of the reference .wav file using single frame LPC. Each uses a different order, as shown in the filename. Notice that the low order versions sound synthetic, and the higher order ones become close to the reference sound. Note that the synthetic recreations could be aesthetically desirable in music production, if one wants to create a new sound based on some reference sound.
