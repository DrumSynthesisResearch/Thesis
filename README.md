LPC Example - 
This folder contains 4 resynthesised versions of the reference .wav file using single frame LPC. Each uses a different order, as shown in the filename. Notice that the low order versions sound synthetic, and the higher order ones become close to the reference sound,even capturing the pitch glide. Note that the synthetic recreations could be aesthetically desirable in music production, if one wants to create a new sound based on some reference sound.

DCT Example - 
This folder contains MATLAB code and dependent audio data which can be used to explore the evolution of modal features with strike velocity, and the interpolation of modal features to generate those of intermediate velocity.

DCT Sounds - 

FDTD Example - 
This folder contains a MATLAB code example of FDTD membrane. The membrane can be iniated with a modal surface or a raised cosine, as options within the code.
